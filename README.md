# Exercise Solutions: Wengrow's "A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms"

## Purpose

The repo holds sample code for performing simple algorithmic analysis exercises, as presented in the excellent book "A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms" by Wengrow ([amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222)).

Each chapter of the book has a set of exercises at the end to check for understanding. Not all of the exercises lend themselves to direct implementations in code, but we can nevertheless use them as jumping off points for writing some data structures and algorithms from scratch to demonstrate the principles addressed in each exercise.

## Repository Structure

The intent is to potentially include solutions and demonstrations in multiple langagues, therefore at the top level of the repository, the code is organized by language for now (currently the only language is typescript). If it gets to be too annoying with other languages expecting configuration files, etc, to be at the root of the repo, we may split things up.
